# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Problem Statement
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, class, etc.

## Dataset
Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## Features Used
- Pclass
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Fare
- Embarked

## Steps
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Encoding
4. Model Training (Random Forest)
5. Model Evaluation
6. Feature Importance Visualization
7. Predict Test Set and Save Submission

## Results
- Validation Accuracy: ~ 0.82
- Feature Importance Plot: see notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open `notebooks/Titanic_EDA_Modeling.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run all cells to reproduce results
